# ✨ IssueTemplates
This repo serves as a copy-paste solution for the identical issues that the different projects are having. 

It was created mostly for personal use as i've been repeating myself in issues in different projects, so here i could actually set up answers better once and copy-paste with minor editing depending on a project.

### ⚠️ Landing page / Website request:

It would be useful to have this project's landing site / website, so any future news articles can link to it and the website would make a better visual representation of the project that could attract more users, developers and contributors.

A simple option is via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), that a lot of github open source projects are using, which Github hosts for free for any repo on their website.

> Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
> No databases are needed to be set up and no servers to configure

> Consider [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You give it [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) templates and Markdown content

### ⚠️ Changelog info text in F-droid

**Is your feature request related to a problem?**

Currently, there is no visible window with the latest changes when you open your app's page in F-Droid.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Add changelog text when you open the fdroid app repo

**Some tips:**

> F-Droid looks for metadata in the app’s source repo. The supported formats for this metadata are borrowed from popular projects that automate uploading this metadata to Google Play Store.

>The one in your example corresponds to Fastlane Supply and is documented [here](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/#changelogs-whats-new). All formats supported by F-Droid are listed [here](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/All_About_Descriptions_Graphics_and_Screenshots/#in-the-applications-source-repository)

**Additional context**

This would be a great option to quickly see the new changes and many apps use this method.
