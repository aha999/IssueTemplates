# âœ¨ IssueTemplates
This repo serves as a copy-paste solution for the identical issues that the different projects are having. 

It was created mostly for personal use as i've been repeating myself in issues in different projects, so here i could actually set up answers better once and copy-paste with minor editing depending on a project.

### Landing page / Website request:

It would be useful to have this project's landing site / website, so any future news articles can link to it and the website would make a better visual representation of the project that could attract more users, developers and contributors.

A simple option is via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), that a lot of github open source projects are using, which Github hosts for free for any repo on their website.

> Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
> No databases are needed to be set up and no servers to configure

> Consider [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You give it [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) templates and Markdown content
