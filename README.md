### Website request:

It would be nice to have this project's landing site / website so any articles in the future can link to it and the website would make a better visual representation of the project that could attract more users, developers and contributors.

A simple option is via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), that a lot of github open source projects are using, which Github hosts for free for any repo on their website.

> Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
> No databases are needed to be set up and no servers to configure
