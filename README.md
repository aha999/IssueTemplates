# ✨ IssueTemplates
This repo serves as a copy-paste solution for the identical issues that the different projects are having. 

It was created mostly for personal use as i've been repeating myself in issues in different projects, so here i could actually set up answers better once and copy-paste with minor editing depending on a project. It's also better if the issues are well documented with the resources to help with implementing the said solution, therefore copy-paste on identical issues.

### ⚠️ Landing page / Website request:

It would be useful to have this project's landing site / website, so any future news articles can link to it and the website would make a better visual representation of the project that could attract more users, developers and contributors.

A simple and free option is via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), that a lot of github open source projects are using, which Github hosts for any repo on their website.

> Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
> No databases are needed to be set up and no servers to configure

> Consider [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You give it [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) templates and Markdown content

### ⚠️ Changelog info text in F-droid

**Is your feature request related to a problem?**

Currently, there is no visible window with the latest changes when you open your app's page in F-Droid.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Add changelog text into a window above the description when you open the fdroid app repo.

**Some tips:**

> F-Droid looks for metadata in the app’s source repo. The supported formats for this metadata are borrowed from popular projects that automate uploading this metadata to Google Play Store.

>The one in your example corresponds to Fastlane Supply and is documented [here](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/#changelogs-whats-new). All formats supported by F-Droid are listed [here](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/All_About_Descriptions_Graphics_and_Screenshots/#in-the-applications-source-repository)

**Additional context**

This would be a great option to quickly see the new changes and many apps use this method.

### ⚠️ Translation platform

It would be great if there was a convenient way for general public to contribute translations.

I can recommend [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), as it's popular, the platform itself is open source (compared to others), can be self hostable, and for open source projects like yours, they host translations for free. Weblate automatically merges translations and if you want you can have different widgets shown in github readme, that displays how much percentage each applied language is translated to in real-time.  It's much more simple for people to translate this way and it's free + less work needed for you.

### ⚠️ Option to force language change

Although the app is translated in one's language, many users may prefer to use English language for the app's interface. The reasons may vary, from better terminology understanding in English language, to just a preference.

Please add an option in the settings to change a language in the app from a default (local) one to a selected one, like English or other.

### ⚠️ Issue templates

Add templates on github for issues, like when users are reporting a Feature request, a Bug report etc.

Issue templates would enable you to get more detailed information in a better format anyone can follow.

Here is a general idea and some instructions on how to make it functional: [GitHub docs  - issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
